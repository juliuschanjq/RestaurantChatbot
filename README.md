# Restaurant Chatbot (Dialogflow) 

Based on a project sample from Singapore's Ce La Vi Skybar & Club Lounge, the ChatBot was created using Dialogflow.. The chatbot helps to easily make a reservation while giving all the information you need about the restaurant on the telegram platform which you may try it yourself @restaurantclv_bot

The chatbot is prepared to respond to the inquiries and give more information to help customers to make the most of their visit. It attempts to address general topics like "menu“, "hours of operation," or "the atmosphere of restaurant”.
